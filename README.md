I have developed a Java microservices project called OrderService using the Spring Boot framework. The primary objective of this project is to efficiently handle API requests for placing orders, providing a seamless and reliable experience for users.

I have implemented separate APIs for different functionalities: for example placing an order, getting order details and reducing the product quantity when an order is placed using the Orderzservice and ProductService component.

In this project, the Service Registry (Eureka Server) is utilized to facilitate the connection of ProductService.

I have verified the functionality of these APIs by testing them with Postman, ensuring that they respond correctly. To persist the data, I have integrated a MySQL database into the project. The database stores the necessary information related to products and orders, allowing for efficient data management and retrieval.

I have employed JUnit testing to validate the functionality and correctness of each method.
